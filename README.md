# clean_architecture_flutter

Clean_architecture_flutter is a Flutter project example that is based on Clean Architecture. (I learned from this [article](https://devmuaz.medium.com/flutter-clean-architecture-series-part-1-d2d4c2e75c47))

## How to run

This project use [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started). If you don't have let's create a new one. After that, you add your key into 
```dart
const String kApiKey = "";
```
2 values in file strings.dart(lib/src/utils/constants/strings.dart) and done
