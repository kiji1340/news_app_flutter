the ***config*** includes the configaruation about the app.

the ***utils*** contains constants, extensions, resources...

the ***data*** layer is in charge of combining 1 or multiple data source. The most common are Memory, Cache, and Remote.

the ***domain*** layer, which is the most important layer, contains the core business logic.

the ***presentation*** is a layer responsible for handling the user interface and user interaction.

like a diagram describes:
The ***Presentation*** layer, I use bloc that helps manage state and event from UI and it only communicates with the ***Domain*** layer via Repositories.

The ***Domain*** layer just gets and sends data via repositories of the ***Data*** layer.

The ***Data*** layer, it can has many ways to handle data but it does not effect to the Domain layer.
